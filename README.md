ARSS-Advanced Regolith Sampler System
EDIT PROJECT
HIGH-LEVEL PROJECT SUMMARY
In the previous Apollo missions, astronauts reported difficulties while handling the regoliths. Being ionized particles due to absorption of solar radiation, regoliths tend to stick to the astronaut's spacesuits &amp; other instruments. Also, scooping was difficult for the scattering of regoliths due to reduced gravity. Hence, We developed the ARSS which uses the RASSOR bucket technology to scoop &amp; trap the regoliths. The specialized bucket can be easily attached to the previous common handle of the toolset that ensures prevention of being a bulky device which makes it a handy tool for collecting samples or cleaning a planetary surface for space exploration or colonization missions.

DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
SPACE TRIDENT TOOLSET
Last year we addressed the issue of the dead weight and longevity of the planetary geology toolset used by astronomers through our project called the Space Trident. Space Trident is an alternative planetary geology toolset for the astronauts for extravehicular activities which included a rake, trenching tool, small & large scoop as tool heads to be connected with the common handle.

The invention was in making a common shaft for the angle rotating device. Hence, instead of adding the rotating mechanism in each tool head, each tool head can be added in a common angle locking shaft. That reduced the dead weight.

After developing the Space Trident, we jumped deeper & found an issue.

According to the geology tool review report of the apollo 11-17 mission, it is evident that the astronauts had severe difficulty while handling the regoliths by the scoops. As they are ionized particles due to the continuous absorption of solar radiation, the regoliths tend to stick to the spacesuits and other instruments. Thus they are classified as potentially dangerous substances by scientists. Additionally, due to low gravity, while scooping, a significant portion of the regolith moves in an upward direction which makes the refill time twice from the anticipated time.



OUR SOLUTION
Hence, this year we have capitalized on the benefits of the Space Trident & have introduced an upgraded alternative to the large scoop to solve the crisis of regolith scattering in lunar gravity and its potential decaying tendencies of materials used by astronomers due to solar radiation ionization. We are calling it: ARSS (Advanced Regolith Sampler System)




WHAT IS REGOLITH?
Regoliths are dust particles that cover planetary surfaces like the moon & are produced due to asteroid impact. Recently advanced researches have proven that the lunar regoliths have almost 45% of oxygen chemically bonded with iron and titanium. Turning these regoliths into oxygen is a significant invention in the step of colonization on the outer planet. Also, scientists are planning to produce water & fuel from these regoliths.



Prospect of ARSS

Hence handling of regoliths is now a burning question to the engineers. RASSOR is an in-situ mining robot that is in its development stage to be used for mining a large number of regoliths for the oxygen generator reactor. However, RASSOR has a large capacity to serve massive scaled operations rather than lower tasks. 



Our ARSS makes this task more simplified for small-scale and frequent excavations. It is a handheld tool head that is attachable to an astronomer's maneuvered handlebar. It is very crucial to support both space expedition and colonization activities.

HOW DOES IT WORK?
Inspired by the development of the RASSOR project, we have considered the rotating regolith trapping bucket.

ARSS uses the battery-powered motor-driven set of bucket blades grouped sequentially to ensure the smooth scooping of the regolith from the planetary surface.

The buckets have cutting teeth to facilitate regolith collection and a hinged gateway to control opening and closing. While rotating in the clockwise direction, the blades scoop up the regolith and trap it. When the astronaut reverses it counter-clockwise, the material gets discharged.

Calculations showed that the astronaut's reaction force is enough to serve as a cumulative counter-reaction force needed to serve the purpose of a small amount. So, we didn't use the counter-rotating drums to mitigate the opposite reaction forces like the RASSOR.

Finally, the previously built handlebar in the space trident toolset was updated to include three buttons near the t-collar, coupled to a wireless communication configuration to communicate with the ARSS tool. By switching the buttons, astronauts may start cutting operations and specify the direction for material discharge.

HACKATHON JOURNEY
We are a group of enthusiasts who believe in continuous improvement and innovation. To us, a problem is nothing but an opportunity to improve. It took a journey from Apollo 4 to Apollo 11 to make the lunar landing dream come true.

Last year, our project won the Global Nominee Honourable Mention award. We are dreamers who believe in upgrading our ideas until we realize the goal we want to achieve. For us, that goal is becoming a global champion in NASA Space Apps Challenge 2021.



The last two-year journey of our Team Mohakash taught us to be focused on the problem we are solving & further go deeper to solve the complex factors behind that problem. Apparently, we realized that our team spirit is capable of fabricating ideas practically through our previous experience of product development in internships. We found the Planetary Space Exploration needs several creators to come ahead to create devices for solving the space expedition tooling problems. Hence, we stepped forward. Firstly, we identified the problems or the space where improvement can be implemented with the recently developed technologies. Then through team discussions, amongst several ideas, the best one was chosen. Following the selected idea, the feasibility was analysed & once viable, the device was designed and prepared for submission.



We would seriously love to thank BASIS for not only hosting Space Apps Bangladesh round but also their immense mentorship & support throughout the project.
